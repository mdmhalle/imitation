imitation

converting a video to frames with ffmpeg: `ffmpeg -i <video_filename> -an <output_path>%04d.png`

screen to imitate also in the shot. (phone?)


last two felt sloppy

should we have consistent framing

interactions



 * source material is key
 * have subjects do a 25min imitation (initation kinda thing)
 * live imitation? (imitate the screen, sub 2 imitates sub 1)
 * many imitations at once (see people in bg doing it)
 * crowd-sourced imitations
 * live bgs is really distracting
 * sound: probably do the sound thing


ideas for shooting locations

 * matthieu's house (friday?), phil's house (sunday?)
 * mom's (or dad's) school (sat?)
 * university building (sat?)
 * church? ...


ideas for people

 * fb event (open to all, but invite specific)


how we are shooting the film

 * same
 * maybe a raspi
 * record sound too


timeline:

  tuesday: confirm locations, chat about stuff

  wednesday: publish facebook event, start recruiting
